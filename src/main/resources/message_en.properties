burrowsWheelerMatrix = Burrows-Wheeler matrix
bwt = Burrows-Wheeler transform
bwtDecode = Inverse of Burrows-Wheeler transform
bwtDecodeAlg1 =C array initialization. It's length equals the size of the alphabet. For simplicity, C-array is indexed \
  both by characters of alphabet and integers (C[i] = C[i-th smallest character of alphabet])
bwtDecodeAlg2First = Counting occurrences of character by scanning input string in cycle.
bwtDecodeAlg2Positive = i is smaller than n. The body of cycle will be executed.
bwtDecodeAlg2Negative = i equals n. Now, each element of C-array stores occurrence of respective character. Program \
  will continue after cycle
bwtDecodeAlg3 = Incrementing the value of C[L[i]]
bwtDecodeAlg4 = Declaration of variable sum, and initialization it to 0
bwtDecodeAlg5First = Enumerating values of C-array. For every character but the lowest one, this equation holds: C[c] = \
  C[c - 1] + occurrence of c in string. This is used in enumeration of C, using already calculated occurrences of \
  individual characters.
bwtDecodeAlg5Positive = i is smaller than σ. The body of cycle will be executed.
bwtDecodeAlg5Negative = i equals σ. Now, each element of C-array stores sum of occurrences of lower characters than \
  respective index
bwtDecodeAlg6 = Storing value of i-th character of C-array to temporary variable
bwtDecodeAlg7 = Setting value of i-th element of C-array to value of variable sum
bwtDecodeAlg8 = Increasing value of variable sum by value of variable tmp. Now, value of variable sum equals sum of \
  occurrences of characters, that are smaller/equals i-th character of alphabet
bwtDecodeAlg9 = LF array initialization. It's length equals n (the length of input string)
bwtDecodeAlg10First = Enumerating values of LF-array. For every element with index i, it's value equals C[L[i]] + \
  L.rank(L[i], i). We already know C[L[i]] for every L[i], now we need to calculate rank. While scanning array from \
  beginning, we are finding for each given character it's occurrences in string L. We know, that value L.rank(L[i], i) \
  equals number of previous occurrences. If we remember for each character this number, we can calculate value LF[i]. \
  It is not necessary to create new array for values of previous occurrences, we can use C-array, in which we will store \
  sum of previous occurrences and number of occurrences of smaller characters.
bwtDecodeAlg10Positive = i is smaller than n. The body of cycle will be executed
bwtDecodeAlg10Negative = i equals n. Now, LF-array is filled by definition of LF-mapping
bwtDecodeAlg11 = Setting value of i-th element of array LF to value of L[i]-th element of array C
bwtDecodeAlg12 = Incrementing L[i]-th element of array C. This set correct value for next occurrence of character L[i]
bwtDecodeAlg13 = Initialization of string S. This string will store value of inverse Burrows-Wheeler transform. It's \
  length equals to n (length of input string)
bwtDecodeAlg14 = Setting the last character of string S to $
bwtDecodeAlg15 = Declaration of variable j and it's initialization to 0
bwtDecodeAlg16First = Every 2 characters, that are equal, and hava j-th occurrence in their respective strings, \
  represent the same character, on same position in S. LF-mapping represent connection between arrays L and F: L[i] = \
  F[LF[i]], and L[i] and F[LF[i]] have same occurrence in their respective strings. (Note: array F is colored gray, \
  because it is not stored, and is displayed only as a tool for visualizing LF mapping)
bwtDecodeAlg16Positive = i is greater/equal 0, the body of cycle will be executed
bwtDecodeAlg16Negative = i is smaller than 0. Now, array S stores final value of inverse transformation
bwtDecodeAlg17 = Setting of i-th element of string S to j-th element of string L
bwtDecodeAlg18 = Change of value of variable j using LF-mapping
bwtDecodeAlgEnd1 = End of algorithm. Inverse transformation for string
bwtDecodeAlgEnd2 = is string
bwtFromSAAlg1First = Enumerating Burrows-Wheeler transform using suffix array. Suffix array is composed of sorted \
  suffixes, BWT-matrix is composed of sorted rotations.  From this, the equality S[SA[i]] = F[i] applies. From the \
  fact that the BWT lines are composed of rotations, it holds that L[i] is immediately before F[i],or it is the last \
  and first character. Using this we can make BWT out of SA.
bwtFromSAAlg1Positive = i is smaller than n, the body of cycle will be executed
bwtFromSAAlg1Negative = i is equal to n. Now, array BWT stores result of transformation
bwtFromSAAlg2True = S[SA[i]] is not 0-th character, we can find character immediately before it
bwtFromSAAlg2False = S[SA[i]] is 0-th character, in rotation there is ending character before it
bwtFromSAAlg3 = Adding character before S[SA[i]] (S[SA[i] - 1]) into array BWT
bwtFromSAAlg5 = Adding ending character into array BWT
bwtFromSAAlgEnd = End of algorithm. Result of transformation is string
bwtSearchStart = n denote length of string, m length of pattern. Gray part of matrix is not stored, it is just tool \
  for visualization. 
bwtSearchAlg1 = Declaration of the variable top, and it's initialization to to 0. This variable indicates the beginning of the \
  interval in the suffix array in which the pattern can be found. We use semi-open intervals, the top position belongs \
  to the interval.
bwtSearchAlg2 = Declaration of the variable bottom, and its initialization to n (string length). This variable \
  indicates the end of the interval in the suffix array in which the pattern can be found. We use semi-open intervals, \
  and the bottom position no longer belongs to the given interval
bwtSearchAlg3First = Scanning the pattern string from the end, for each character, we find out where the pattern \
  suffix can begin. Since the rows of the Burrows-Wheeler matrix are rotations, we need to find out which positions in \
  the last column of the matrix (L) can be a continuation of the pattern. These can only be in rows where the previous \
  part of the pattern has already been found, and therefore only on those that are highlighted. We find out what \
  indexes have characters from given interval, which are the same as from the end of the i-th character of the pattern, \
  and from the properties of LF-mapping we then know on which new interval the extended pattern suffix is located.
bwtSearchAlg3Positive = i is greater than / equal to 0, the cycle body is executed. In the body of the cycle, the \
  index values of the next pattern character in the string L, which are at the highlighted interval, are determined
bwtSearchAlg3Negative = i is less than 0. Now the variables top and bottom indicate the interval at which the \
  positions of the beginnings of the pattern occurrences in the string are located in the suffix field
bwtSearchAlg4 = Loading the next character from the pattern
bwtSearchAlg5 = Change the value of the variable top, using the newly added pattern character
bwtSearchAlg6 = Change the value of the variable bottom, using the newly added pattern character
bwtSearchAlg7Positive = The variable top is greater than the variable bottom. Since they delimit a half-open interval, \
  it must now be empty, and pattern is not occurring in the string
bwtSearchAlg7Negative = The variable top is less than the variable bottom, the interval of possible solutions is \
  non-empty, and we can continue the algorithm. The Burrows-Wheeler matrix highlights characters that point to a \
  matching part of the pattern in the string
bwtSearchAlgEndNegative = End of algorithm, no occurrences found
bwtSearchAlgEndPositiveSg = End of algorithm. The occurrence of the pattern is in position
bwtSearchAlgEndPositivePl = End of algorithm. The occurrence of the pattern is in positions:

SAGeneralAlgorithmEnd2 = LCP-array (Longest Common Prefix) is associated with suffix arrays, which stores maximum common \

WGBackwardStepsAlg1 = Finding a edge position with the last character of the original string
WGBackwardStepsAlg2 = Declaration of the variable offset, and its initialization to 0. This variable will store \
  relative ordering of entering tunel edges, which will then be used when exit from the tunnel, to determine the \
  correct continuation of the path
WGBackwardStepsAlg3First = In this cycle, the edges on which the original string are stored will be gradually detected. \
  When walking, we can use backward step, using LF-mapping, and we also remembering if we entered a (one) tunnel.
WGBackwardStepsAlg3Positive = The value of the variable k is less than the string length. The body of the cycle will \
  be executed
WGBackwardStepsAlg3Negative = The value of the variable k is equal to the length of the string. Now the reverse of the \
  original string stored in the given Wheeler chart is stored in the SR variable
WGBackwardStepsAlg4 = Storing the edge label on which we are right in the chain SR
WGBackwardStepsAlg5 = Using LF mapping to find out what position the edge is in the array in (and in the string F)
WGBackwardStepsAlg6 = Finding the value of the vertex in which the edge at position i enters
WGBackwardStepsAlg7Positive = Since the vertex we are entering has more input edges, it means that we have encountered \
  the entrance to the tunnel
WGBackwardStepsAlg7Negative = The vertex does not indicate the beginning of the tunnel
WGBackwardStepsAlg8 = Finding a relative edge position, due to the remaining edges entering the tunnel
WGBackwardStepsAlg9 = Finding the position of the first output edge of the vertex we are currently in
WGBackwardStepsAlg10Positive = The vertex has several output edges, which means we are at the end of the tunnel, and \
  it is necessary to come out the same edge in the relative order we entered the tunnel
WGBackwardStepsAlg10Negative = The vertex has just one output edge, it is not an output from the tunnel
WGBackwardStepsAlg11 = Adding the relative order of the edge we entered the tunnel. At position i is now the correct \
  value of the output path
WGBackwardStepsAlg12 = Setting a variable offset to 0

WGFromBWT = BWT represented by Wheeler graph

WGFromBWTEnd = The given Wheeler graph represents the embedded BWT. You can try to transform it, retrieve the input \
  string, or tunnel it.
WGFromBWTDescription = Creating Wheeler graph, which represent Burrows-Wheeler transform
WGFromBWTPreStart = Input string for which the Burrows-Wheeler transform will be created, followed by \
  creation of Wheeler graph, which will represent the transformation.
WGFromBWTStart = The Wheeler graph representing the Burrows-Wheeler transformation with length n has n vertices. Each \
  vertex has exactly one leading edge and one trailing edge. For each edge, that starts from vertex i, it enters \
  vertex LF[i] (array LF is LF-mapping), and is labeled by L[i]. We will be adding edges one by one, in LF-mapping \
  order (ie the inserted edges will create reversed input string)
WGTunneling = Wheeler graph tunneling
WGTunnelingNegative = We have not found any prefix interval in this graph. You can try any of the examples
WGTunnelingPositive = The paths of the longest prefix interval we found in a given graph are marked with blue and red. \
  The algorithm merge these paths in two parts. In the first, it merges all vertices in pairs, thereby creating \
  multiple edges between them. In the second part these multiple edges will merge into one. The beg variable stores \
  the value of the first vertex of the first path of the prefix interval, the end variable stores the first vertex \
  value of the last (second) path. Variable w indicates the width of the prefix interval, ie the length of each of \
  it's paths
WGTunnelingAlg1 = Initialization of variable h, which stores height of the interval, ie the number of paths, \
  in our case 2
WGTunnelingAlg2 = Initialization of the x variable, which stores the value of the first vertex in the first path of \
  the prefix interval. During the algorithm, the values of all vertices from the first path will be gradually \
  stored in it. To movement along the vertices we will use LF-mapping
WGTunnelingAlg3First = The vertices of the prefix interval are gradually merged in the cycle. Changing 1 to 0 in the in\
  array, in i-th position means that the i-th edge enters the vertex with a value one smaller than before. Also, all \
  edges on higher position will change theirs entry vertices, and will enter the vertices with a value of one smaller. \
  Analogously, when changing 1, the 0 in the out array, the ending vertices of edges will change. If the value \
  changes in both places then the appropriate vertex has no edges and we can exclude it.
WGTunnelingAlg3Positive = The value of the variable k, is less than w - 1, the cycle body is executed
WGTunnelingAlg3Negative = The value of the variable k is equal to w - 1, the program continues after the cycle. Now \
  the vertices of the paths of prefix interval are merged, and multiple edges have been created between them. In the \
  next part, we will merge these edges
WGTunnelingAlg4First = In this step, the value in in[x + 1] is set to 0, which means that the ending positions of some \
  edges are shifted. For visualizations we will also change the value in out[x + 1] to 0 (highlighted position in the \
  out array), and after this part of the program we will return the original value to the given position. This means \
  that we have merged the first vertices of the interval
WGTunnelingAlg4Other = In this step, the value in in[x + 1] is set to 0, which means that the k-th vertices in the \
  prefix interval have been "merged". We will also show this change on the graph.
WGTunnelingAlg5 = Change the value of the variable x, using LF mapping. This will store the value of the next vertex \
  from the first path of the prefix interval
WGTunnelingAlg6 = Set the value in out[x + 1] to 0, which means that the starting positions of some edges are shifted. \
  We do not show this change on the graph, we will do so only at the next change in the in array.
WGTunnelingAlg7 = Initializing the variable i. Also, for visualization, we set the value in the in array to 0, so that \
  the last vertices of the prefix interval are merged. (The position is highlighted)
WGTunnelingAlg8 = Initialization of the variable j. Using these variables, the values in the in, out, and L strings \
  will be shifted
WGTunnelingAlg9First = In this cycle, multiple edges created in the previous section are merged. In this process, it \
  is not possible to properly visualize the changes in the graph, and therefore only the values in the in, out, and \
  L arrays will change. We returned the original values in the in and out arrays, which were made only for visualization.
WGTunnelingAlg9Positive = k is less than the size of the number of edges, the body of the cycle is executed
WGTunnelingAlg9Negative = k is equal to the number of edges, the program continues after the cycle. When the in and out \
  arrays and the L string are shortened, an succinct representation of the tunneled graph is created. This will be \
  done on the next lines
WGTunnelingAlg10Positive = The value of the in array at position k is 1
WGTunnelingAlg10Negative = The value of the in array at position k is 0
WGTunnelingAlg11 = Setting the value of the array out at position i, to the value at position k
WGTunnelingAlg12 = Setting the character of the string L at position i, to the character at position k
WGTunnelingAlg13 = Incrementing the variable i
WGTunnelingAlg14Positive = The value of the array out at position k is 1
WGTunnelingAlg14Negative = The value of the array out at position k is 0
WGTunnelingAlg15 = Setting the value of the array in at position j, to the value at position k
WGTunnelingAlg16 = Incrementing the variable j
WGTunnelingAlg17 = Shortening the L string to length i
WGTunnelingAlg18 = Shortening the array out to length i + 1
WGTunnelingAlg19 = Setting the last element of the array out to 1
WGTunnelingAlg20 = Shortening the array in to length i + 1
WGTunnelingAlg21 = Setting the last element of the array in to 1
WGTunnelingEnd = And this is what a tunneled graph for a given input looks like
